# Algorithm Implementations in PHP

This project includes three algorithm implementations using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Each algorithm is presented on its own webpage with a simple and clean user interface.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**
   - Calculates the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices.
   - Implementation file: `matrix_chain.php`

2. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
   - Finds the length of the longest subsequence present in both sequences.
   - Implementation file: `lcs.php`

3. **0/1 Knapsack**
   - Determines the maximum value that can be put in a knapsack of a given capacity.
   - Implementation file: `knapsack.php`

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Each algorithm's result is presented on a Bootstrap-styled webpage, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Separation of Logic**: Each algorithm is implemented in its own PHP file, maintaining separation of concerns.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can view the results of each algorithm calculation directly on the webpage.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Youssefkhaled74/algorithm-project.git
